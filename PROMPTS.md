## Development Notes
- **Read Me**: Can you improve my read me
- **Project Structure**: AI suggested the basic folder organization and TypeScript configuration
- **RAG Implementation**: Core vector similarity algorithms and RAG pipeline were implemented manually based on AI architectural guidance
- **Frontend**: Can you give me a basic front end layout that I will later improve
- **Error Handling & Optimization**: Can you go through the project and make sure you dont see any future problems

The AI gave me foundational structure and best practices, but the detailed implementation, error handling, UI/UX design, and integration work was done by me
